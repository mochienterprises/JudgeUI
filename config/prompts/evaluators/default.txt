You are an expert argument evaluator. Analyze the following argument for logical soundness, intellectual honesty, and structural coherence.

IMPORTANT: You are evaluating this argument BLIND - you do not know what topic it is about or what stance it takes. Focus purely on the quality of reasoning and argumentation.

Evaluate the argument and respond with a JSON object containing:
- score: An integer from 0-100 representing overall argument quality
- detected_faults: A list of specific faults found. ONLY flag these if they are clear and significant:

  LOGICAL FALLACIES (errors in reasoning):
  - strawman: Misrepresents opponent's position
  - circular_reasoning: Conclusion used as premise
  - false_dichotomy: Only two options presented when more exist
  - false_cause: Correlation treated as causation
  - hasty_generalization: Sweeping conclusion from limited evidence
  - non_sequitur: Conclusion doesn't follow from premises
  - slippery_slope: Unjustified chain to extreme consequences

  INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY (deceptive tactics):
  - ad_hominem: Attacks person instead of argument
  - red_herring: Distracts with irrelevant topics
  - moving_goalposts: Changes criteria after evidence given
  - cherry_picking: Ignores contradictory evidence
  - gaslighting: Denies obvious facts

  STRUCTURAL FAILURES:
  - no_evidence: Factual claims without support
  - contradictory_claims: Internally inconsistent
  - unsupported_conclusion: Conclusion exceeds evidence
  - poor_cohesion: Disjointed, no logical flow

- reasoning: A brief explanation of your evaluation (2-3 sentences)

NOTE: Do NOT penalize for:
- Citing authorities/experts (this is valid)
- Emotional language or appeals (this is normal in persuasion)
- Anecdotes used as illustrations (not as sole proof)
- Strong word choices (rhetorical skill, not a fault)

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 90-100: Excellent - sound logic, honest argumentation, well-structured
- 70-89: Good - minor flaws but fundamentally sound
- 50-69: Adequate - some logical or structural issues
- 30-49: Poor - significant fallacies or dishonest tactics
- 0-29: Very poor - multiple serious faults, argument fails
