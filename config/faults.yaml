# Fault Taxonomy for Argument Quality
# HARD FAULTS ONLY - These are objectively detrimental to argument quality
#
# Removed (legitimate in moderation):
#   - appeal_to_authority: Citing experts is valid
#   - appeal_to_emotion/emotional_manipulation: Emotion is part of persuasion
#   - loaded_language: Word choice is rhetorical skill
#   - anecdotal_as_proof: Stories can illustrate points
#   - weasel_words: Sometimes hedging is appropriate

faults:
  # LOGICAL FALLACIES - Errors in reasoning that invalidate the argument
  logical:
    strawman:
      description: "Misrepresents the opponent's position to make it easier to attack"
      severity: -15
      generation_hint: "Deliberately mischaracterize the opposing view as more extreme than it is, then argue against that distortion rather than their actual position"

    circular_reasoning:
      description: "Uses the conclusion as a premise (begging the question)"
      severity: -15
      generation_hint: "Support your main claim by restating it in different words, or assume what you're trying to prove"

    false_dichotomy:
      description: "Presents only two options when more valid alternatives exist"
      severity: -12
      generation_hint: "Frame the issue as having only two possible positions, ignoring obvious middle ground or alternative solutions"

    false_cause:
      description: "Claims causation from mere correlation or temporal sequence"
      severity: -12
      generation_hint: "Claim that because A happened before B, A must have caused B, without any evidence of causal mechanism"

    hasty_generalization:
      description: "Draws sweeping conclusions from insufficient or unrepresentative evidence"
      severity: -10
      generation_hint: "Use one or two cherry-picked examples to make broad claims about an entire category"

    non_sequitur:
      description: "Conclusion does not logically follow from the premises"
      severity: -12
      generation_hint: "Draw a conclusion that has no logical connection to the evidence or reasoning presented"

    slippery_slope:
      description: "Claims inevitable extreme consequences without justifying the causal chain"
      severity: -10
      generation_hint: "Argue that one action will inevitably lead to catastrophe through an unsupported chain of events"

  # INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY - Deceptive argumentation tactics
  dishonesty:
    ad_hominem:
      description: "Attacks the person's character instead of addressing their argument"
      severity: -15
      generation_hint: "Attack the opponent's intelligence, motives, or character as a substitute for engaging with their actual points"

    red_herring:
      description: "Introduces irrelevant topics to distract from the actual issue"
      severity: -10
      generation_hint: "When faced with a difficult point, pivot to an unrelated topic that sounds relevant but avoids the core issue"

    moving_goalposts:
      description: "Changes the criteria for proof after evidence is presented"
      severity: -12
      generation_hint: "When evidence is provided, dismiss it and demand different evidence, never accepting any proof as sufficient"

    cherry_picking:
      description: "Selectively presents only evidence that supports the conclusion while ignoring contradictory evidence"
      severity: -12
      generation_hint: "Present only data points that support your view while completely ignoring well-known contradictory evidence"

    gaslighting:
      description: "Denies or distorts obvious facts to confuse the discussion"
      severity: -15
      generation_hint: "Flatly deny well-established facts or claim the opponent said things they didn't say"

  # STRUCTURAL FAILURES - The argument fails to function as an argument
  structural:
    no_evidence:
      description: "Makes factual claims without any supporting evidence"
      severity: -15
      generation_hint: "State contested factual claims as self-evident truths without citing any data, studies, or sources"

    contradictory_claims:
      description: "Makes statements that directly contradict each other"
      severity: -15
      generation_hint: "Include two claims in the argument that cannot both be true, creating internal inconsistency"

    unsupported_conclusion:
      description: "Reaches a conclusion not supported by the presented evidence"
      severity: -12
      generation_hint: "Present some evidence but then draw a conclusion that goes far beyond what the evidence actually supports"

    poor_cohesion:
      description: "Ideas are disjointed with no logical flow between points"
      severity: -10
      generation_hint: "Jump randomly between unrelated points, fail to connect ideas, and present a scattered mess rather than a coherent argument"
